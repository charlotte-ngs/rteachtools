\usage{
deploy_src_to_ex_sol(ps_uni_src_path)
}
\description{
This function takes as input the unified Rmd source files containing exercise problem
questions and solutions to these problems. From the unified Rmd file the solution pdf
document is produced. The solution section in the unified Rmd source file must be tagged
by a given html-comment. These tags are used to produce a reduced Rmd source file which
does not contain the solutions to the exercise problems. The reduced Rmd file is used
to produce the exercise pdf document.
